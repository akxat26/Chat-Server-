**Chat Server using Java**

The *Chat Server* project, developed using Java, is a robust and scalable application that enables real-time communication between multiple clients. The server uses socket programming to create a multi-threaded environment where each client can send and receive messages in a seamless chat experience. It supports both one-to-one and group chat functionalities, ensuring that clients can communicate privately or in a group setting.

The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port, establishes a connection with clients, and then manages these connections using individual threads. This multi-threading approach ensures that the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously without performance degradation. Each connected client is assigned a unique thread, which enables the server to track and manage users independently. 

The server maintains a list of active users and facilitates broadcasting messages to all connected clients or to selected individuals. Communication between clients is handled via input and output streams, which are efficiently managed using Java's I/O classes. The project also incorporates features such as error handling, user authentication, and message encryption to provide a secure and reliable messaging service.

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) can be integrated using JavaFX or Swing to improve user experience, allowing users to visualize chat rooms, active users, and ongoing conversations. Additionally, features like message logs, file sharing, and notifications can be added to extend the functionality of the chat server.

This *Chat Server* project is highly modular, making it easy to extend with new features or integrate into larger systems. It serves as a foundational framework for learning network programming in Java and understanding core concepts like sockets, multi-threading, and inter-process communication.
